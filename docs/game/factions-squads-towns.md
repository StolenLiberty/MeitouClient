# Factions, squads and towns

Original FACTION/Platoon/population/town research: binary functions, FCS and merged database/save
checks. Tables/expressions retain fields and event values. Runtime: [simulation](../simulation.md);
[AI](ai.md), [economy](economy.md), [save format](../formats/save.md).

## Relations and world states

**Verified** initial A→B: explicit A.relations v0, otherwise min(A.default,B.default); self100.
Hostile<=-30, ally>=50; directional flags/coexistence and event changes are distinct. Storage,
trust/known/player-faction branches and dialogue/reaction events remain scoped Observed where
not independently checked. Start-off relation overrides are not fully decoded.

WORLD_EVENT_STATE (`FUN_1409a7e00`, **Observed** by code): holds when every `NPC is` CHARACTER has unique state v0 (0 dead, 1 alive,
2 imprisoned), no `NPC is NOT` one has its v0, each `player ally` FACTION is (v0 1) or is not (v0 0) the player's ally and each `player
enemy` hostile to it. With `player involvement`, an `NPC is` other than alive or an `NPC is NOT` alive also needs the unique's player
flag. A unique with no entry counts as alive, so a new game answers by the data alone; nothing is stored. A `world state` list entry
(`FUN_1409a9a70`: spawn gates, weighted picks, campaigns) passes when the state's answer equals (v0 == 1); a missing record is skipped.

## Squad factory

**Observed/Verified sentinel checks:** per entry count=v0 when v1=0 or100; otherwise inclusive
v0..v1, reversed range givesv0. Apply size multiplier/truncation/min1 unless dont-multiply.
Create leader role2, random choosefrom then squad role0/squad2 role1, animals/animals2, slaves
role4 as recursive squads, prisoners into available home cages. First member can become leader.
**Prisoners** (`FUN_140583a10`, **Observed**): only with a home building; its cages (`BuildingFinder_CagesWithinBuilding`) are counted, then each `prisoners` entry makes a
platoon of the entry's `faction` (else the owner's) whose members each go into a random remaining cage (`FUN_140330600`, lock set) with `Character+0x190 = 9999999` (meaning
**Unknown**); with no cage left, one member is removed and placing stops. A squad that made prisoner or slave squads gets no building shop ([economy](economy.md#shops-and-transactions)).
Offsets `(3*(i%8),3*floor(i/8)+(i%2))`, animals2 spacing5 (spawn places). Followers' slots by FACTION `squad formation`: [squads travelling together](pathfinding.md#squads-travelling-together); Meitou's: [simulation](../simulation.md#movement-and-paths). Age=max(0,r*animal-age-random-0.1+v2/100).
Unique members go through one gate: [unique characters](#unique-characters).

Generic weighted refs: v0=0 means100; exclude nonpositive weights and false world states,
first cumulative weight exceeding uniform roll wins; single candidate no roll. SpawnInfoList
instead drops v0<=0 and budgets expected squad sizes using its separate sentinel/range rules.
Do not reuse one zero-weight convention for both.

## Unique characters

**Data** (merged base files, throwaway survey): 155 of 639 CHARACTERs have `unique`; 13 of them have exactly one `unique replacement spawn`
(no record has more, no non-unique has one). Uniques are named by SQUAD_TEMPLATE `leader` 99, `squad` 54, `choosefrom list` 51, `squad2` 1,
FACTION_CAMPAIGN `special leader` 57, WORLD_EVENT_STATE `NPC is` 113 / `NPC is NOT` 60 and dialogue conditions; 34 by more than one template
(Dust King leads 3; recruits sit in several towns' recruit lists); 9 by none. Templates with a unique leader are listed by TOWN `residents` (99)
and `bar squads` (33). Two UNIQUE_SQUAD_TEMPLATEs exist (`General Epson Army`, `UNIQUE bandit test`), each in one FACTION's `special squads`.

**State** (`UniqueNPCManager`: one global map CHARACTER record → entry, `FUN_140354560`; **Verified** by code, meanings of `state` from `fcs.def`
`NPC is`; the 9 sample saves hold 302 entries, all state 1 / player false):

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| claimed | the CHARACTER record once a squad created it; null or no entry = free to create (`FUN_1405921b0`) |
| handle | the live character, recorded when it gets its handle (`Character` slot 16, `FUN_140623920`) |
| state | 1 alive (also for a new or absent entry), 0 dead, 2 imprisoned/captured |
| player | the player was involved (killed, imprisoned, holds it) |

**Transitions** (**Verified** by code unless marked):
- Create (`FUN_1405836e0`, used by `FUN_140583a10` for `leader`, `choosefrom list`, `squad` and `squad2` alike): a claimed unique is replaced by
  its first `unique replacement spawn` (created without the gate, recorded by slot 16 like any unique if it is one; all 13 targets are
  non-unique except `Protector Of The Flame`, which names itself, so it can be duplicated), or by nobody; a free one is claimed (handle
  reset) and created.
  So a dead unique (claimed stays set) never comes back, a v0 > 1 entry yields one copy plus replacements, and a missing leader does not stop the
  squad (the first member made leads). The platoon's +0xac is set when a unique member is made (use **Unknown**).
- Death (`FUN_1407a6200`): state 0; player set (never cleared here) when the killer's faction is the player's. The dead unique's faction's
  "prosperity" (`FactionUniqueSquadManager` +8) drops by 100, floor 0.
- Imprisoned in a cage or restraint (`FUN_140330600`): state ≠ 0 → 2, player set when the cage's owner is the player's. `DA_ENSLAVE_TARGETS_CARRIED_PERSON` / `DA_ARREST_TARGETS_CARRIED_PERSON` (0x28 / 0x1e), which
  take a carried unique off its carrier, do the same, player set when the carrier is the player's (`FUN_140680560`).
- Periodic refresh (`FUN_1405cf470`, from the character's slot-80 update `FUN_1405d00b0`): state 1 and carried by a non-ally → 2 (player = carrier
  is the player's); state 2, not carried, not imprisoned, and in the player's faction or allied with its squad's → 1, player cleared; state 0, in
  the player's faction and not dead → 1 (**Observed**: the ally/town tests are summarised).
- Unload of an active platoon (`FUN_1407ef4b0` → `FUN_1409a8120`), for each unique member in state 2 or away from its ownership town: dead, down,
  carried by a non-friend or `+0x279 & 7` → state 0; free and well → entry erased (`FUN_1405067e0`, only if state ≠ 0 and the stored handle's container (C, CS) is
  this platoon: a unique registered to another squad is not released) and the platoon re-creates its members from the template on activation (+0x118 = 1), which claims the unique again;
  imprisoned away from friends → 2 (**Observed**; a 0.1 roll against the faction's town list in the free branch is **Unknown**).
- An activating platoon in spawn mode 3 (home no longer valid) whose template leader is unique releases the template's unique
  leader/squad/squad2 entries registered to it (`FUN_1404ffad0` → `FUN_1404ff760`) (**Observed**).
- New game and every load (`FUN_1409a8970`): map cleared, then the unique leader/squad/squad2 of each SQUAD_TEMPLATE's first `prisoners`
  template → state 2 unclaimed (base game: Cat of `Dust King Prisoner`, `Tengu's vault prisoners`, `agnu`). Import marks every imported unique
  claimed (`FUN_140378a30`).

**Queries**:
- WORLD_EVENT_STATE (`FUN_1409a7e00`): `NPC is` needs state = v0, `NPC is NOT` state ≠ v0; with `player involvement` the player flag must
  also be set (`NPC is` with v0 ≠ 1, `NPC is NOT` with v0 = 1) (**Verified** by code).
- Campaign check (`FUN_1409c4ed0`): passes with no `special leader` or one in state 1 (a never-made one counts). Gathering (`FUN_1409c5040`),
  leaders in list order, first usable wins: a registered handle → its platoon; else the SQUAD_TEMPLATEs naming it `leader` (more than one only
  logs "ERROR: unique NPC with more than 1 squad referencing it", the first is used) are spawned if the unique is free. Lord Mirage (a
  non-unique `special leader`) has no entry, so `UC town racists fort` (the template he leads) can be spawned for every campaign;
  Yayoi has no template. `specific target NPC`s count when state ≠ 0 and the handle
  has a non-zero position (`FUN_1409c5e80`, `FUN_1409a7d90`) (**Observed**).
- Towns have no extra rule: a `residents`/`bar squads` template with a unique leader passes the create gate above, so while the unique is
  claimed elsewhere or dead the squad comes with the replacement or without the leader (**Observed**).

**Special squads** (FACTION `special squads` → UNIQUE_SQUAD_TEMPLATE, v0 = number to keep per `fcs.def`): `FUN_1402ddc90` makes per entry
{template, v0, timer, live platoon handles}. The update `FUN_1402dd680` (each war-manager run, `FUN_1406b97c0`, with the faction's accumulated
time) raises prosperity by 0.1·dt toward 1000 and counts timers down; when a timer is 0 and fewer than v0 live, it returns: **nothing spawns
them** (**Verified**: by code, the only spawn-near-own-town helper `FUN_1402dda60` has no callers; 0 of 3,502 PLATOON records in 9 saves are
`special`, every `sqtime` is 0). A `UniquePlatoon` (`FUN_14057c6f0`: UNIQUE_SQUAD_TEMPLATE, or a saved PLATOON with `special`) adds a
mission ticker (every 10 s pick a `missions` DIPLOMATIC_ASSAULTS entry by its `conditions`: `FUN_1409a7930`; not decoded), saves
`missionTimer` and `missionRepeatsCount` per mission (slot 23), and on destruction unless kept tells the manager, which drops its handle and
sets the timer to 2618.18 × `replacement time` / 24 (`FUN_1402de9b0`; unit **Unknown**).

## Population and contents

Area-sector grid uses the4608-zone coordinate system with9-unit offset; biome populations,
homeless/roaming pools, nests, town residents/bar/roam squads and campaigns have separate caps,
spawn distances/timers/owner rules. Nest debris and regenerating squads are stateful. Towns
resolve faction, homes/parts/material replacement, residents, interiors, contents and culture.
World-state replacement towns and faction ownership affect both population and building data.

**Sector and nest counts** (**Verified** by code): a platoon is filed in the area sector of its position (`FUN_1408f6c80`, from the platoon constructor and
`Platoon::vfunc_28`): persistent platoons and nest squads into a set that is not counted, the rest into the counted set (+0x60, size +0x70), moved to a third set
(+0x88, size +0x98) while imprisoned or dead but still loaded; a sector's load is +0x70 + 0.5 x +0x98 against its group's cap. A nest's or town's pool is the set
of platoons whose `hometown` is it, by `sqt` (1 residents, 2 roaming), counted in living characters ([save keys](../formats/save.md#npc-platoons-meitou-mapping)).

Loot/building inventories, artifacts, shop stock, prisoners/slaves and placed debris derive
from different reference lists. Preserve slot/count/quality/owner fields and forbidden-item
rules rather than treating every list as uniform random loot. Story NPCs: [unique characters](#unique-characters);
campaigns: [campaigns](#campaigns).

### 1. Object model

| Game class (RTTI) | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Faction` | one per FACTION record (103 in the base game, the player's included); owns its record (+0x240), a `FactionRelations` (+0x78), the platoon lists, `FactionUniqueSquadManager` | `FUN_1407fe270` is the loader from the record (**Observed**). Player flag: the field at +0x250 is non-null only for the player's faction (**Observed**, also in [game-loop.md](game-loop.md)) |
| `FactionRelations` / `PlayerFactionRelations` | the relation table of one faction towards all others | section 3 |
| `Platoon` -> `ActivePlatoon` (characters exist) / `UnloadedPlatoon` (abstract) / `UniquePlatoon` | a squad; `UniquePlatoon` only from an UNIQUE_SQUAD_TEMPLATE ([special squads](#unique-characters)) | per-frame stepping is in [game-loop.md](game-loop.md#update-threads-and-budget); creation is section 5 |
| `TownBase` -> `Town`, `Nest` | a TOWN record placed in the world; nests are TOWN records of `type` 0 spawned by the game | section 7; `Town`/`Nest` share almost all virtuals, the nest overrides slot 103 (wiped out) |
| `BasePopulationManager` -> `TownPopulationManager`, `NestPopulationManager` | per town: two pools (residents, roaming) with a population budget and a `SpawnInfoList` | section 6.4 |
| `SpawnInfoList` | the weighted list of squad templates a pool or biome group may spawn | section 6.1 |
| `AreaSector`, `AreaBiomeGroup` | one cell of a 64 x 64 grid of 4608-unit cells, and the BIOME_GROUP data it belongs to | section 6.2 |
| `BuildingItemGroup` | an ITEM_PLACEMENT_GROUP placed in a building: one item slot with a respawn timer | [loose items](#loose-items-in-buildings) |
| `FactionWarMgr`, `CampaignData` (always `StartInvasionData`) / `CampaignInstance` (always `GatherAndMove`) | faction campaigns (FACTION_CAMPAIGN) | [campaigns](#campaigns); DIPLOMATIC_ASSAULTS not decoded |

**Persistent platoons** (**Verified** by code): a zone's unload (`ZoneMapContent::deactivate`, `FUN_1409fe980`) touches no platoon; each platoon checks
itself (`FUN_1404febd0`) and after 4 s outside every loaded zone (`FUN_1406bab60`, `FUN_1407ec570`) becomes an `UnloadedPlatoon` (`FUN_1407ef4b0`, its characters
copied into an in-memory record container, no file written) when its `persistent` flag (+0x115) is set or it is in a live campaign, else it is destroyed
(`FUN_1406ba9d0`). Town residents are made persistent (`FUN_14057f820`, with `sqt` 1); pool refills, homeless squads and `FUN_1409c4150` are not. A
non-persistent unloaded platoon is activated after 60 s (`FUN_1407ee790`) and then destroyed, so it lasts about 64 s out of range. An unloaded platoon
becomes active after 2 s inside a ready zone (`FUN_1407ebf30`), its characters rebuilt from the kept records; at game load each PLATOON is made active or
unloaded by its zone (`FUN_1407f85f0`). `declareDead` (`FUN_140797090`) clears `persistent` (destroyed at its next unload, its PLATOON record deleted by
`FUN_1407ec5e0`). No distance, age or emptiness rule removes a persistent platoon. A wiped-out town refills only through its pools, with non-persistent squads;
no path re-running the initial resident placement was found (**Unknown** whether one exists).

**The player's dead** (**Verified** by decompile; Meitou `SquadManagement.BuryDead`): the death handler (`FUN_1407a6200`, the "{1} is dead." strings) moves a
character whose faction is the player's (+0x250) out of its platoon (vfunc 0x18) into the faction's `__DEAD_SQUAD__` platoon (vfunc 0x10); NPC platoons keep their
dead. `FUN_1407f4960` makes that platoon the first time through the squad factory `FUN_1407f4420` with no template, sets its record name to `__DEAD_SQUAD__` and keeps its
handle in the game state (+0x2d0); the CAMERA loader (`FUN_1407f3fb0`) finds it again by that name. It is no squad tab, and import skips it ([save](../formats/save.md)).
**Unknown**: its file's string id, and `FUN_1407ebdd0(platoon, 0)` called on it and on an emptied platoon. The handler's `FUN_140797090` call when the dead is the
platoon's `+0xa0` member does not fit the `declareDead` reading above; unresolved.

### 3.1 Storage (**Observed**)

| Offset | Type | Meaning |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| +0 | byte | "allied" flag: forces `isAlly` true (set for the faction itself; other setters not found) |
| +2 | byte | at-war flag (set by declare-war, cleared by end-war; nothing found reads it, and the save has no key for it, **Observed**) |
| +3 | byte | coexistence flag (set from the FACTION `coexistence` list) |
| +4 | float | **relation**, -100 .. +100 |
| +8 | float | accumulated positive trust |
| +0xc | float | accumulated negative trust |

On the faction's FactionRelations object itself: +0x10 int rank, +0x18 float **global trust** (starts 0; slot 9 adds, DC_REPUTATION reads it as an int; not saved, **Observed**; the player table's saved `global trust` is read and written at +0x14, relation to +0x18 **Unknown**). Meitou: `FactionRelations.GlobalTrust` / `AddGlobalTrust`.

### 3.2 Faction rank

- The player's rank in a faction is an int at `FactionRelations` +0x10 (the faction's +0x78), 0 by default. **Verified** by code: saved as
  GAMESTATE_FACTION int `rank` (writer `FUN_1406b37b0`, reader `FUN_14003c2ea` / `FUN_1406b4dc0`; key string at 0x141700eb8), present on
  every non-player faction (102 per save in two saves).
- Read by DC_FACTION_RANK (10) and raised by DA_INCREASE_FACTION_RANK (35) of the **speaker's** faction ([dialogue](dialogue.md#effects)).
- **Verified** (probe of the merged data): only the Shinobi Thieves use it. Joining (`*You clasp hands* Welcome /BROTHER/...`) pays 10,000
  (DA 8), raises the rank to at most 1 (DA 35 val0 1) and relations +100 (DA 4); rank 0 lines turn the player away ("Talk to the boss",
  "I don't know you"), rank 1 lines open the shop and smuggling talk, and rank > 0 the free plastic surgeon.
- The FACTION loader (`FUN_1407fe270`) reads strings `rank0`, `rank1`, ... into a list (Faction +0x18; rank titles, **Unknown** use); no
  base FACTION has any. Ints `num ranks` / `num negative ranks` (1 on many factions) are not read there (**Unknown**).
- Meitou: `FactionRelations.Rank` / `RaiseRank`, loaded from and written to `rank`.

### 3.3 Thresholds (**Verified**: -30 and 50 appear in the predicate functions, in the threshold-message function `FUN_1406b28f0` and in the declare-war gate `FUN_1406b3000`; re-read independently)

| Predicate | Rule | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| hostile(A -> B) | B != A and relation(A -> B) <= -30 (default value when no entry) | `FUN_1406b25d0`, `FUN_1406b26d0` (identical bodies); called by `FUN_14092c5e0` (town choice) and `FUN_1409a7e00` (world state) |
| "default-hostile faction" | the faction's own table default (+0x60) is **strictly below** -30 (**Observed**) | inline in `FUN_1404374d0` (target choice, together with fundamental type 0 or 8) and in `FUN_14092c5e0` (combined with `ally()`); this is not the pair relation |
| ally(A -> B) | B == A, or allied flag, or relation >= 50 | `FUN_1406b2630` |
| coexists(A -> B) | B == A or coexistence flag | `FUN_1406b23c0` |
| value as a fraction | relation x 0.01 (and its negative) | `FUN_1406b2460`, `FUN_1406b24c0` |

### 3.4 Changing relations (**Observed**; the event table cross-checked with the dialogue action numbers)

Vtables: `FactionRelations::vftable` 0x14171a958, `PlayerFactionRelations::vftable` 0x14171aa18 (slots 0/1 save/load, 10 the entry lookup).
The player's table has **empty** slots 2 to 5 (`FUN_140812e40`..`e70` return at once): no event or direct add ever changes the player's own
row; slots 6 to 9 are shared. Each slot works on the calling faction's entry about faction B; when B is the player's faction, slots 5, 7 and 8
post the threshold message of `FUN_1406b28f0` (section 3.3) with the calling faction's name.

| Slot | Function | Effect |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 3 | `FUN_1406b3190` | relation -= 35 (if > -100), clamp |
| 4 | `FUN_1406b2ea0` | relation += a x b, clamp to [-100, 100] (direct add; `DA_AFFECT_RELATIONS`, slave trading +/-4, missions, the witness's -20 of 3.5) |
| 5 | `FUN_1406b2d20` | event of kind k and amount x, see below; does nothing when B is null or the owning faction has `not real` |
| 6 | `FUN_1406b2560` | a > 0: trust += a x b, else negative trust += a x b |
| 7 | `FUN_1406b2f90` | end war: clear war flag; if relation <= -25 set it to -25 (just above hostile) |
| 8 | `FUN_1406b3000` | declare war: only if relation >= -30 (not hostile yet): log "War breaks out between {1} and {2}" (owner, B) if the flag was clear, set the flag, set relation to -35 when it is -35 or more |
| 9 | `FUN_1406b2530` | global trust (+0x18) += a, no clamp (`DA_AFFECT_REPUTATION`, called on the **speaker's** faction) |

Kind rows (the move `FUN_1406b2730`: a fall applies only while relation > floor, a rise only while relation < ceiling, then clamp to [-100, 100]):

| Kind | delta | floor | ceiling | Fired by (3.5) |
| ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 1 | -0.05 x | -20 | 100 | a landed blow |
| 2 | -2.5 x | -50 | 100 | a downing blow by a low-rated striker |
| 3 | -10 x | -50 | 100 | a downing blow |
| 4 | -20 x | -100 | 100 | a killing blow (with 2 or 3) |
| 5 | -20 x | -75 | 100 | a death with a known killer |
| 8 | +0.15 x x dt | -100 | +5 | first aid to an unconscious member (dt = `DAT_142133794`, scaled frame time) |
| 12 | -10 x | -60 | 100 | put in a cage |
| others | none | | | the bed put-in passes 9 |

### 3.5 What fires relation changes (**Observed**, decompile)

Found by a scan of every `CALL [reg+0x28]` preceded by a constant kind, and of the vcalls through `Faction+0x78`; only these call slot 5.
Every event is the **victim's** faction's table about the **doer's** faction, for any two factions (NPC fights included), with amount
**x = w x victim `faction importance`** (`FUN_140796020`; `Character+0x41c`, CHARACTER float read by `FUN_14062b210`; **Verified** by probe:
all 639 merged base CHARACTER records have it, 102 are 0, 371 are 1, uniques up to 100). w = 1 when the town the victim stands in
(status `+0x88`) is its own one (ownership object `+0x30`), 0.6 when that town's faction is `ally()` of the victim's (same faction
included), else 0.025 (outside every town too).

| Deed | Where | Events |
| --- | --- | --- |
| melee blow lands | `FUN_1404394f0` (Character slot 62) via `FUN_140999f00` | kind 1 when the striker's status float `+0xac` > 0.1 (and the victim's combat byte `+0x130` clear); after the damage, if the victim is unconscious or dead (`+0x5b9`/`+0x5bc`): kind 2 if striker `+0xac` <= 0.15 else 3, plus kind 4 if dead. Every later blow on a downed body repeats it |
| bolt lands | `FUN_140439c90` via `FUN_140999d50` | as melee, thresholds 0.1; with no shooter nothing; a bolt whose flag (param 4, read as "aimed") is clear gives no kind 1 and kind 2 |
| death | `FUN_1407a6200` (sets `+0x5bc`, runs inside the damage, so before the blow's own events) | kind 5 against the killer recorded in the character's handle at `+0x2c0` (**Unknown** setter), and squad tag 9 |
| caging | `Task_PutInSomething` `FUN_140358670`, after the bounty claim | kind = task `+0x7c`: 12 for the cage task, 9 (no row) for the bed (factory `FUN_14032ebd0`) against the putter's faction |
| first aid | `FUN_140649a00`, `FUN_14064d800` | kind 8 to the medic's faction when the patient's medical `+0x161` (unconscious) or `+0x160` is set; in `FUN_140649a00` only on an update whose loop filled every wound |
| ally witness | `FUN_140854d10` | a witness that regards the suspect as friendly (vfunc `0x3f0`) and sees it wrong its own faction: slot 4, -20 (skipped when the witness platoon's `+0x210` object has `+0xa8`); for every crime code but 2, 10, 11, 14, 16; repeats on each witness pass |
| missions | `MissionClass` vfuncs `FUN_14039f580` / `FUN_14039f660` | trust (slot 6) and a direct add (slot 4) of the mission giver's faction about the player |
| dialogue | `FUN_140680560` | DA 4 slot 4, DA 5 slot 9, DA 13 slot 8, DA 14 slot 7, always the **speaker's** faction about the target's ([dialogue](dialogue.md#effects)) |

- No other caller of slot 7 or 8 was found: wars start and end only by dialogue (`FactionWarMgr` campaigns do not call them).
- Kind 8 is not a drift: nothing moves relations back over time.
- Status `+0xac` (Character slot 61 `FUN_140598b90` returns it) is summed by the perception (`FUN_140854370`) as a threat value; its setter is
  **Unknown**. Meitou rates every striker above both thresholds (kinds 1 and 3; engine choice).
- `FUN_140673a20(self, other, tag)` (not a witness function) sets a long-term tag (`CharacterPerceptionTags_LongTerm`, read by DC 23) in
  `self`'s squad memory (`platoon+0x98`, `FUN_140673930`, time-stamped): 1 MY_INTRUDER (trespass), 5 MY_CAPTOR (cage), 7 / 8 (the victim's
  squad tags the striker DEFEATED_MY_SQUAD_ONCE and the striker's tags the victim SQUAD_LOST_TO_ME_ONCE, on a downing blow when
  `FUN_140793160` finds the victim's squad all down), 9 KILLED_MY_FRIEND (death). Meitou keeps the memory ([dialogue](dialogue.md#squad-memory)) and writes 5 for cagings and arrests; the other deeds do not write it yet.

Meitou: `FactionDeeds` (blows, cagings, first aid), `CrimeSystem` (the ally witness), `PlayerRelations.DeclareWar` / `EndWar` / `Add`
(the messages); [simulation](../simulation.md#hostility-and-relations).

| `building`, `building dislike`, `building designation`, `layout interior/exterior`, `public day/night`, `public beds`, `bed usage cost`, `sell home`, `building ruined`, `initial door state` | how the squad's home building is chosen and set up (resident squads) |

### Loose items in buildings

**Verified** by code (`BuildingItemGroup`: constructor `FUN_1405534f0`, timer `vfunc_28` `FUN_140549e60`, spawn `FUN_140547ed0`, pick `FUN_1409540d0`, grade
`FUN_14063cea0` / `FUN_140952320`, save `vfunc_17` `FUN_1405567b0`) and a census of the merged install data and `interiors.level`:

- Interior layouts (`interiors.level` INSTANCE_COLLECTIONs) place ITEM_PLACEMENT_GROUP records like furniture: 4987 objects in the layouts of 31 associated buildings
  (15307 slots over 129 towns once the level buildings take their layouts), each with its own state (`floornum`, `respawn time`, `is inside building`, `isInsideBuilding`
  handle). The 21 groups have a vendor list's lists: `items`, `weapons`, `clothing`, `weapon manufacturers` (v0 the weight, 5..500), plus `random yaw` (true in all),
  `min respawn time` / `max respawn time` (24 / 48 in 19, 72 / 72 in 2) and `placeholder` "".
- A placed group is one item slot at its object's position and rotation, with a handle to its item and a respawn deadline in game hours (0 at start). Each update with no
  item: once the clock reaches the deadline (and a test on the building's town `+0x1d8`, **Unknown**) it makes one. With an item whose handle is still a WEAPON, ARMOUR,
  ITEM, CONTAINER, NEST_ITEM, MAP_ITEM, CROSSBOW or LIMB_REPLACEMENT that is not taken: nothing. Otherwise the handle clears and the deadline becomes now + an int in
  [min, max] hours.
- Making one: a weighted pick over the group's lists (a roll in [0, total weight) against running sums); a WEAPON pick takes a manufacturer from `weapon manufacturers`
  and the weapon is made by it. Every item gets the quality of a weighted grade (0..5 -> 5, 20, 40, 60, 80, 95); the grade weights' source is **Unknown** (the item-list
  object is cached per group record and a value of the building, probably its faction). The item gets a value of the group (**Observed**: likely the owner faction) and is put
  at the slot. BLUEPRINT and MAP_ITEM picks get extra bookkeeping (**Unknown**).
- Saved per group (in its generated interior): `base data sid`, `floornum`, `isInsideBuilding` handle, `is inside building`, `respawn time`, then its item.

Meitou: [ground items](../simulation.md#items-and-eating).

### Town residents

**Observed** (kenshi-named dump) unless marked; Meitou: `PopulationHomes.cs`.

- **Table** (`FUN_140935d10`, `FUN_140936e60`): the faction's `residents` then the town's; with `residents override` the
  town's only. A template already listed is skipped (first wins). Per entry: v0 = count, v1 = priority (100 counts as 0,
  outside 0..5 an error box). `default resident`: the town's, else (no override) the faction's. `bar squads`: the
  faction's (TownType 2 only, no override) then the town's; with override the town's only.
- **When**: at zone populate (`FUN_140a0e760`) per non-player town, the zone's buildings sorted by handle serial (random-looking).
- **Candidates**: buildings of the town ([membership](../formats/zones.md#town-membership)) with an `interior` reference, not player-owned, holding no residents template
  or the default one; walls (`links together`, a vfunc override) never, gates (`is wall gate`) only for entries naming
  `building`s. Level data agrees: 1946 walls, none with a resident.
- **Driver** (`FUN_1409370d0`): re-owns the buildings to the town's faction; priority 5 down to 0, each entry with count
  left gets one building per pass, passes repeat while one placed and has more. An entry with no building left makes
  no more squads (Stack: civilians v0 9, 2 made). Then every free building whose interiors take the default resident's
  `layout interior` gets it (`FUN_14092e4b0`).
- **Chooser** (`FUN_14092e870`): a template with `layout interior` needs a building offering it (own layouts or
  `shares interiors with`; gates exempt); without one, an entry naming buildings takes only those. Weight 1, x 0.4 when
  `layout exterior` is not offered, x 10 named in `building`, x 0.05 in `building dislike`; highest wins, first on a tie.
- **Squads** (`FUN_14057f820`): `housemates` (v0, or Rand(v0, v1) when v1 > 0) first, then the squad. Platoon point: a
  random free node of NodeType 0 (SHOPKEEPER), else 2 (GUARD_POST), else 1 (GENERAL), else the building. Characters
  (`FUN_140583a10`): a GENERAL node, else SHOPKEEPER, at node + (0, 10, 0), else the platoon point. The squad's home is the building.
- **Bar squads** (`FUN_1409fcd20`): n = v0 > 2 ? (int)(v1 x 0.005 x v0) : 0, then +1 per Rand(0, 100) <= v1, stopping
  at the first failure, at most v0. Each at a random node of the town's node map (`FUN_14038b000`), else the town
  position; no home. That map (NodeList +0x50) is filled by `FUN_14038b650` with nodes the game creates itself next to objects
  (record `1186-gamedata.base`, "Node Guardpost", node type 2); which objects is **Unknown** (Meitou: GENERAL nodes of its bars).
- **New game vs level data**: level-data building states carry `residents template` / `squad template`; save 2 against
  them has the same multiset per town but shuffled across buildings (223 same, 125 moved), so a new game rerolls homes
  (**Observed**). Destroyed buildings stay candidates (the Hub's ruins house squatters).
- **Meitou engine choices**: the level data's assignment is kept where it fits the rules (interiors are drawn from it,
  not relaid to the template's layout); on a tie a building already laid out as the template wants wins; bar squads
  stand in the town's bars and take the nearest bar as home (their templates, e.g. `Bar thugs`, have designation 0, **Verified** in the data); a loaded town keeps its saved squads, homes and bar squads and rolls no new bar squads.

### Off-screen world

**Verified** by code (kenshi-named dump) unless marked. Who is kept off screen: [persistent platoons](#1-object-model).

- **No world pass**: work is spread over round robins. Each faction steps one platoon of its list per frame (`FUN_1406b9970`, unloaded
  ones only); one faction per frame runs its war manager (`FUN_1406b97c0` → `FUN_1409cb310`); one town and one nest per frame get growth /
  spawn / wipe (`TownList::vfunc_4`); the area tick every 2 s (new nests, homeless squads), sector housekeeping every 10 s. Each unloaded
  step measures its own elapsed game time, and growth and campaign timers read the game clock, so no rate depends on these periods.
- **Unloaded step** (`UnloadedPlatoon::vfunc_2`, `0x1407ee790`): activation test, the 60 s orphan timer, then (not the player's, not
  imprisoned, not at a loading zone's edge) the job: a campaign's if the war manager holds the platoon, else the package's `unloaded func`
  ([ai.md](ai.md)); job 0 becomes 2 for a non-persistent platoon and 4 (GOHOME) for a persistent one. No character data is read or changed:
  no healing, needs or fights (**Observed**).
  - GOHOME: to the home only once within 2000, else to the object of a platoon handle (+0xb8, meaning **Unknown**) at 55.
  - TRAVEL_TARGET / _FAST: to the mission target: the blackboard's override package's, else the campaign's target, else the current
    package's saved `mission target`, else a fallback (`FUN_140269cd0`); no move when it is the town the squad is in (**Observed**); a campaign's `travel speed unloaded` WALK / JOG / RUN gives 25 / 55 / 90;
    otherwise (GROUPED, NO_SPEED_CHANGE, no campaign) FAST 60 (90 beyond 25000), TRAVEL_TARGET 25. The mover caps speed at 70 (**Observed**: no other writer of the cap).
  - PATROL_SHORTRANGE: picks a point in a neighbouring 4608 sector of the same biome group (sometimes a town, `patrol approaches towns`)
    but sets no speed, so it does not move (**Observed**). PATROL_TOWN, PATROL_LONGRANGE: no branch, no movement.
  - Movement is a straight line, no navmesh. Roads (`0x14065f940`, **Verified** unless marked): for a destination over 10000 away with
    w = max(0, 1 - `road preference`) < 1, the entry and exit are the nearest projected points on any road within 20000 (X/Z; roads with
    the +8 flag skipped), scored by distance minus a pull towards the travel direction (reversed for the exit) of clamp(w, 0.2, 0.9). The road is
    taken when the two access legs together, and the legs plus w × the A* road length (`FUN_14045da60`; cost **Unknown**), are each no longer
    than the straight line; the mover then heads for the first waypoint, keeping the final destination. Road data: ROAD records (`start`, `end`,
    `length`, `width`, `weight`, `hidden`), their instances the polyline points; `start`/`end` are junction numbers, each road one edge costing its
    `length` (not its polyline; `weight` unread), the A* heuristic the straight distance to the goal, and `hidden` never read by routing (**Verified**).
- **Meetings**: nothing looks at other platoons; there is no off-screen combat. Off-screen outcomes are campaign phases and despawning.
- **Pool growth** (`FUN_1408f4c20`): each pool's current max (`pop`) grows `+0.21818` per game hour (5.24 a day) up to its desired max
  (`popd`), for every town whether loaded or not; roaming grows only once residents are within 1 of full. Towns never spawn squads over
  time by themselves (only nests call the pool spawner). Once per town load (`0x14092a020`) a squad that lost ≥ 60 % of its spawn size, if
  the budget allows, is marked to be made afresh from its template on its next activation.
- **Despawn cost**: a non-persistent squad that leaves while not intact is taken out of its pool, lowering `pop` by its living members.
- **Town pools in saves** (**Observed**, saves 1, 2, wade): every town has `pop` = `popd`, `started` true when populated, `popd2` 0 (none of
  304), while `read_roaming_population_n4` (`0x1408f98d0`) would set pool 2 to the faction's `roaming population` (no caller found:
  **Unknown** when it runs). `pop` is near the living members of the town's resident platoons (`is resident`) of the town's own faction:
  save 2 Squin 36 = 36, the Hub 12 vs 10, Stack 93 vs 95 (Squin without a Tech Hunters resident shop of 4).
- **Town wipe** (**Observed**, `TownPopulationManager::vfunc_4`): roaming `pop` ≤ 3, ≤ 25 roaming living and no intact resident platoon
  sets `ded`.
- **Nests** (`NestPopulationManager::vfunc_4`): pool 2 starts at 0.7 × `nest resident population` and grows as above. While the nest's
  zone is loaded it spawns one squad per tick (weight `max(0, v0 − existing) × faction wealth`; an entry passes when its size fits the free budget `floor(pop2)` − living, or
  the pool is empty and more than 4 are free, so a squad bigger than the budget can open a nest: `FUN_1408f7e80`, **Verified** by code) unless a
  player-faction unit is within 1250. With no candidate and no intact squad the nest is `ded` ("wiped out", game hour stored as `tod`,
  **Observed**) and never spawns again. New nests come only from the area tick, up to `num nests` per biome group; whether a dead nest
  frees its count is **Unknown**.
- **Homeless squads** (area tick `FUN_1408f9240`, every 2 s, per island): the island's load (sum over its loaded sectors of counted +
  0.5 × imprisoned/dead, clamped to [0, 2] for a sector by a town) is compared with `FUN_1408f5ca0`, the sum of P × `homeless spawn
  amount` over the loaded zones of the island; while below, one sector is picked by weight max(0, P × amount + 1 − load), halved by a town,
  (w + 1) × 2 when empty, and one squad is made there (`FUN_1408f8060`) if its count is below P × amount, retrying other sectors when that
  fails. So a loaded sector is refilled as its squads die or walk out (**Verified** by code). The squad is given a home town: the
  sector's own town when its faction is the squad's, else the faction's nearest town, or its nearest nest when that is 9216 nearer, none
  beyond 50000 (`createRandomUnloadedSquad` → `Ownerships::setHomeTown`, KenshiLib 1ce4a16 names; **Verified** by code). It tethers the
  patrol (below). Saved homeless platoons have no `basetown`/`hometown` ([save.md](../formats/save.md)); whether the home is saved
  elsewhere is **Unknown**. Meitou decides it at the squad's first patrol, from where it stands (engine choice, so saved squads get one).
- **Patrol task** (`Task_Patrol`, loaded; **Verified** by code and disassembly unless marked): the platoon's `PatrolInfo` (+0x1e8: biome
  group, has-home flag and home town position, sector range near/far, `patrol approaches towns`, a smell factor) is made once; the
  start sets the range to (1, 2), or (0, 1) when the platoon has a home town, then orders a move whose destination (`CharMovement`
  slot 20, mode 3) is drawn by `FUN_1408fc730` from the leader's position:
  1. A coin flip takes the four diagonal or the four straight neighbouring sectors; those of the same biome group with sector flag
     +0x32 clear (its writer not found: **Unknown**) and weight > 0 enter a cumulative pick.
  2. Weight (`FUN_1408f5ad0`): 1 for a sector whose zone is not active. Active: n = its counted platoons + 0.5 × the others (the area
     tick's sets: non-persistent platoons not homed to a nest are counted); 10 / n when n = 0 (an infinite weight; the pick then
     runs off its map, so the result is undefined), 5 / n when n < 2, else 1. Plus the zone's smell × the smell factor, but that factor
     is `blood smell mult` read from the template's bool fields, so it is always 0 (**Observed**). With a home town, × 5 when the
     sector's Chebyshev distance d from the home's sector equals near or far, × 10 between, × 0 outside: a homed patrol stays within one
     sector of its home's sector, and homeless squads have one (above).
  3. With `patrol approaches towns` and towns in the drawn sector (`TownList::getTownsInArea`), each player town enters at even odds
     with weight 1 and each other town at 1 in 4 with weight 0.2; a drawn town's `getPositionForWaypoint` is the target (a cached point:
     in front of a gate near the centre, or the centre; **Observed**). Else a placed spot in that sector (`FUN_1408f50d0`); with no
     neighbour, `FUN_1408fc1a0` takes the first active sector of the group (not the player's, no town, fewer than 2 excluded platoons)
     where a spot is placed, else a random sector of the group; it ignores the tether.
  A loaded patrol draws again whenever its move order is re-issued (the task's update, once the move has ended); the order's radius is
  1250 (**Observed**). Off screen a new point is picked within 500 of the last (`FUN_1407ee790`). Meitou: the weights above with n the
  homeless squads standing in the zone and 10 for an empty active one (engine choice), the tether, re-pick within 500, the town's centre;
  with no neighbour, a point of the home's sector, else of its own (engine choice).
  `patrol approaches towns` is set on 933 of 961 squad templates of the merged load order, the Starving Bandit and Dust Bandit roamers
  among them, so their patrols target NPC towns as above; no other town check was found (**Verified**, record dump).
- **Traders**: restocked only while active, when the clock passes the platoon's `inventory refresh time`; an unloaded one catches up at
  its first active tick.
- **Prisoners** (**Observed**): frozen with their platoon; sentences are absolute timestamps and release is a loaded AI task.
- **Campaigns**: [below](#campaigns); they run whether loaded or not.

### Campaigns

Raids, assaults, tax/tribute and trader visits, ally reinforcements: one `FactionWarMgr` per faction (Faction +0x88), stepped in the round
robin above. **Verified** by code (kenshi-named dump; disassembly where noted) unless marked. Save layout: [WAR_SAVESTATE](../formats/save.md#war_savestate-type-9-faction-campaigns).

**Data** (**Verified**: merged base files, 179 FACTION_CAMPAIGN records). Content is aimed at the player: raids and assaults on player
towns, hunts after story kills, visits, ally help; chains via victory/loss triggers. No NPC-town-against-NPC-town campaign exists.
- Rolled ones: a FACTION's `campaigns` list (77 links, 24 factions; ref values ignored) with `territorial triggers` (60 of them).
  `chance per day` 0.05-2 (mostly 0.1-0.5); `range near`/`range far` in tenths of a unit (e.g. 2500/9000; 50000/90000 = the whole map).
- `key` = the editor's `WarCampaignEnum`: 0 ASSAULT_TOWN (159), 1 CONQUER_TOWN (none), 2 DEFEND_TOWN (13: "Ally ... (trigger)"),
  3 TRADER_VISIT (7: merchant visits, crab champion).
- `travel speed loaded/unloaded` = `MoveSpeed`: WALK 0, JOG 1, RUN 2, GROUPED 3, NO_SPEED_CHANGE 4 (data mostly 4/1).
- `num forces` 2-80 (characters); `repeat limit` days (4 typical, 9999+ = once); `target population min` 0 (163) or 1-6.
- `repetition limit` (33 records) belongs to dialogue and is unread here; `lock campaign` (one DIALOGUE_LINE) is unread by the exe
  (**Observed**: no such string). `victory AI leader/others` (13) are unread: the loader builds only `pt1 AI`, `pt2 AI`, `retreat AI`.
- `inherits from` (144 records, up to 2 parents; AI packages live on BASE parents): every ancestor is applied twice, by the loader
  and again by the record reader (**Observed**). Appended lists (`squads to use`, `special leader`, victory/loss triggers) thus count an
  ancestor's entries twice (double weight); AI packages and `trigger player ally` are inherited (the child wins where set); `world state`
  merges by query. Own-record only: scalars and bools, ranges, chance, `key`, `num forces`, `faction override`, speeds, `dialog announcement`.

**Roll** (`FUN_1409cb310`): each run updates every active campaign, then the requests, then, when the clock passes `updatetime`, sets it
to now + 6 h and, only if the faction has no active campaign and no pending request, rolls (**Verified** +6; gate **Observed**).
- Each `territorial triggers` campaign of the list with a target gets chance c; it passes when c > uniform[0,1); one passer is drawn,
  weighted by c (**Verified** by disassembly).
- c (`CampaignData::vfunc_1`), 0 on any failure: against a player-faction target, the player's living characters ≥ `target population min` and a Town
  target's level (+0x388, the save's `plevel`, below) ≥ `target tech level >=` ("-below town level"); now > last start + `repeat limit` × 24 h; world states and special leader (below); d = XZ
  distance from the faction's nearest own town to the target: f = 1 when `range far` ≤ 0 or d ≤ near × 10, 0 beyond far × 10, else
  linear from 1 to 0 between; f × `raidFrequencyMult` unless `ignores chance mults`; c = `chance per day` × 0.25 × f (**Verified**).
- Target (`CampaignData::vfunc_0`): only towns of the player faction, those in the faction's `biomes` (BIOME_GROUP), else any player town;
  dropped when Town slot 70 is false, when the town has hostile occupiers (+0x128) and the campaign is not hostile, or in the faction's `no-go zones`
  unless `ignores nogo zones`. Slot 70 (`FUN_140929eb0`, **Observed**: zone flag `FUN_140a09360` read as loaded): a zone of the town is loaded and, for a
  player town, a player character's town is it; so rolls (and redirects) only aim at a player town the player is at. +0x128 is the count of the town's
  occupier set (+0x118, filled by [Package_OccupyTown](ai.md#package-classes); **Verified**: the town panel's "Hostile Occupiers:" line, `FUN_140922e60`).
- Player town level (+0x388, `FUN_14048c200`, **Verified** by code; 0 for a new outpost; recomputed when towns merge, `FUN_140931840`, and in `FUN_1404d1870`):
  over the town's player buildings H = with an interior (Building +0x1f0) that are neither parts nor gateways, T = turrets (BF 12), G = gates (BF 21), R = the
  highest research functionality `tech level` (BF 3). 1 when R > 1, H > 1, G > 0 or T > 3; with G > 0, 2 when R > 3, H > 4 or T > 4, 3 when R > 3, H > 4 and T > 6. Sources: own towns except nests (and, for
  factions with `fundamental type` 1 or `offers bounties`, villages, points of interest, prisons, slave camps); the first source in list
  order with one of its 5 nearest candidates within `range far` is the home (**Observed**).
- World states (`vfunc_2`): every `world state` query equals its val0, and no `special leader` or one with unique state 1 (**Observed**).

**Start** (`FUN_1409c9830`): home missing or disabled → the nearest own town to the target. Required men = int(`num forces` ×
`raidSizeMult`) (**Verified** by disassembly). Gathering stops once men > required (each platoon adds its living members):
1. the `special leader`'s platoon; if not spawned, the squad template naming it `leader`, spawned within 700 of the nearest own town;
2. the faction's free, idle, intact homeless platoons (of a `squads to use` template when the list is set);
3. for each of the 4 own towns nearest the target: such platoons homed there, then new squads drawn from `squads to use` by val0, within
   700 of the town (at the leader once there is one), up to 100 per town; none when the list is empty.

Too few: "Assault to {1} canceled due to faction weakness" (when the target is the player's), nothing else. Success: "{1} on the way to
{2}" (not hostile) or "Warning: {1} moving towards {2}", last start = now, and each `trigger player ally` campaign (needs a `faction
override`) whose faction is the player's ally (allied flag or relation ≥ 50) is requested there with no delay. No relation, war or world
state change. Drafted and new platoons stay kept while the campaign is not ended (`FUN_1407ec570`); whether new ones are `persistent` is
**Unknown**.

**Requests** (`FUN_1409c9410`): victory/loss trigger rolls, retries, ally help and DIALOGUE_LINE `trigger campaign` (to the speaker's
faction; target: talking to the player's side, the player-faction town nearest the speaker (XZ, nests excluded, `FUN_140927bb0`),
and nothing is queued when the player owns none, so a homeless player gets no dialogue campaign, e.g. no crab tournament; another party:
its platoon's town; no other party: speaker +0x1a0 → +0x88, **Unknown**; **Observed**, `FUN_140680560`) queue a campaign with a due time, target, home and
target faction. A weighted list [v0, v1, v2] fires one entry when uniform[0,100) < Σ v2 (v2 = percent), due after uniform[v0, v1) hours
(**Verified** for dialogue by disassembly, **Observed** for the rest). `faction override` hands the request to that faction; a duplicate
(same campaign and target) pending or active is dropped. Due requests check only world states and the leader (no chance, range, cooldown
or population); a failed start retries each run, up to 100 times; a gone target is redirected or delayed 5-10 h, at most 10 times
(**Observed**). Requests can aim at NPC towns. A requested campaign joins the receiving faction's list for good.

**Phases** (`CampaignInstance::vfunc_10`, every war-manager run, loaded or not; times are game hours since the phase began):
- Any phase but ended: the leader platoon loaded with every member down → defeat.
- 0 travel: arrived within 0.8 × town radius (XZ; `Town::getRadius`, a player town's [reassessed radius](buildings-production.md#placement), at least 1250) or 400 of a non-town target; then the `dialog announcement` waits, "{1} has arrived at
  {2}", and phase 1, or straight to ended without victory or defeat when there is no `pt2 AI leader`. A loaded, non-hostile, non-DEFEND
  campaign within 1.8 × radius of a town with hostile occupiers (+0x128) is defeated at once (a trader or ally does not walk into an occupied town).
- 1 at target: victory when the leader is back in its home town (two null towns compare equal); else by `key`: ASSAULT_TOWN wins after
  4 h, earlier 0.2 h after its first fight once the fight or the standing player characters are gone and the town's buildings test passes;
  while > 2 player characters hold the town, more than half up, nothing else is checked; DEFEND_TOWN after 12 h when no hostile campaign
  against the player runs; TRADER_VISIT after 1 h unless trading (**Observed**). Then any key: defeat when < 20 % of its platoons are
  intact (the flag is recomputed only while loaded).
- 2 ended: removed after 3 h (platoons unmapped).
- Unloaded no fight starts, so an unloaded assault always wins at 4 h: a message and its follow-up, nothing happens to the town (the
  earlier "an empty outpost falls" reading was this).
- Redirect (`FUN_1409d62f0`, **Verified** by decompile; where the update calls it is **Unknown**): when the target town no longer resolves, or its faction is the player's and slot 70 is false (the player has left it),
  a timer (+0xf0, started the first time this is found, restarted after each look) lets the war manager look for a new target every 0.2 h with the campaign's target rule
  (`CampaignData::vfunc_0`, [above](#campaigns)); a different town found replaces the target ("{1} has redirected to {2}", {1} from `FUN_1409d3fe0` read as the campaign's name (**Observed**), {2} the town) and the home stays. None found keeps the old one. Meitou:
  `PopulationCampaigns.Redirect` (no look for a campaign with no target faction, an engine choice).
- Packages: phase 0 `pt1 AI`, 1 `pt2 AI`, 2 `retreat AI`; the leader platoon uses `... leader`, others `... others` (else the leader's).
  Installed (`FUN_140272570`, **Verified**) at the platoon's next AI update: when the phase's package differs from the blackboard's override
  (+0x210) the old one is torn down (dialogue event 30 on the leader) and the new one built by its `signal func` (0 → 33 Contract_Timed),
  timed for 24 h and run ahead of the template's packages until its finished test passes (WarBase: the platoon is out of the campaign).
  Classes by `signal func` (**Verified**): 19 Package_WarBase (pt1 "Military Assemble leader/forces"; activate sets job 5 TRAVEL_TARGET
  for the leader, 6 TRAVEL_TARGET_FAST for the others, and the target and mission target from the campaign), 20 Package_WarAssault (pt2
  assault, slave raid, loot food; speed mode 2, the base's 4), 32 Package_WarAssault_Cannibal; retreat packages use 1, 5 or 0 with
  `clears existing jobs`. Goals (**Observed**, data): pt1 leader 215 TRAVEL_TO_TARGET_PACKAGE, 143, 129 MAKE_ANNOUNCEMENT_FAST; pt1
  others 215, 15; pt2 16 (attack enemies), 15, 216, 270, 276 or 131; cannibal 216, 254, 270.
  - Kidnapping (**Verified**, data query of the install's AI_PACKAGE records for task enum 254 "Find and kidnap (with cages) urgent"; 132 and 246 are in no
    base package): the leader goal list of `Cannibal Raid Retreat` (the `retreat AI leader` of "BASE Basic Invasion", "slave raider silent", its
    "non slave trade" copy and "BASE- standard cannibal raid"), `Cannibal raid assault town` (the pt2 leader of the cannibal raid), `Cannibals at home`, the squad
    goals of `Cannibal patrol map (short range)` and `Assault and kidnap` (a DIALOGUE_LINE's `delivery AI package`). So raiders (bandit invasions, slave
    raiders, cannibals) kidnap when their leader retreats from a raid, cannibals also during their assault, on patrol and at home. The task (254, final state 153 got a
    victim, then 154 put the carried one in a cage) needs a free squad member to lift a downed one and a cage of its faction. The target is the nearest
    down, uncarried, uncaged, non-animal character of the sensed classes (and, unlike rescue, a sleeper in a bed); the class bits are **Unknown**
    ([finder](carry-loot.md#32-goals-and-their-target-finders)). Not every raid kidnaps: the Dust Bandit "Invasion with demands" and the Hive, Ninja and Crab
    raids retreat with other packages (**Verified**, same query). The retreat package's mission town is the platoon's home town, else the nearest town of its
    faction ([ai, prisoner packages](ai.md#prisoner-and-slaver-packages)); what the captors then do: [ai-tasks](ai-tasks.md#prisoner-fate-and-slave-rows). Meitou:
    [kidnapping](../simulation.md#kidnapping), [captives](../simulation.md#captives).
  - Enemies: the base package, in a hostile campaign's phase 1, tags each seen target-faction character with squad memory 4 (TEMP_ENEMY,
    as DA 21); WarAssault tags every seen character except those of another town, with an engine flag (slot 0x248), or of factions with
    +0x1d0 or +0x34 == 8 set (meanings **Unknown**).
  - Cannibal: from the first member carrying someone (+0x348, **Observed**) a timer runs; phase 2 at 3 carriers or after 15 game minutes.
  - Dialogue (`FUN_140680560`, **Verified**): DA 37 sets phase 1 (2 without a pt2 leader package), DA 38 phase 2, DA 39 phase 3, which no
    phase handles (only a leader wipe ends it; the data never uses DA 39).
- Moving: unloaded, the leader travels to the target (TRAVEL_TARGET), the others to the leader (TRAVEL_TARGET_FAST), speeds as the
  unloaded step above. Loaded (`GatherAndMove`, **Verified**): each run the leader's trail gains its position when over 150 from the newest
  point (seeded with slots + 1 points within ±100; slots 5, or N + 1 past N platoons) and drops its oldest while longer than N; follower i's
  point is i × slots × 150 / N back along it. Whether followers steer to it or to the leader platoon's position is **Unknown** (the task
  prefers the handle's). Task 215 (`Task_TravelToMissionTarget_ArmyFormation`): followers 100 or more from their point JOG, closer match
  the leader (× 0.9 under 70); the leader uses `travel speed loaded` while every intact platoon (loaded, or unloaded on job 5/6) is within
  6000, else stops within 8294.4 of its target (plain distance), else walks. Speed modes: WALK default, JOG 55, RUN and GROUPED 999 (no
  cap), NO_SPEED_CHANGE unchanged.
- Announcement (task 129 in the pt1 leader package, **Verified**): "{1} has arrived at {2}" once; with the leader within 2500 of the camera
  and a target-faction member within 2500 of it, `dialog announcement` fires as event 2 ANNOUNCEMENT with no target; phase 0 then waits on
  the leader's event-2 state (which state: **Unknown**). Talking to a campaign member (event 1) is refused without a pending `interrupt`.
  "Invasion with demands" (data): the announcement sets the negotiation as `interrupt`; paying 2000 (DA 8 + DA 38) retreats and requests it
  again in 42-56 h; refusing is DA 37 (attack); stabbing the speaker is DA 21 + DA 38 and the "EXTRA ANGRY" campaign in 20-50 h.

**End effects** (the only callees): victory: "{1} against {2} has ended" (hostile) and one `victory trigger` roll. Defeat: "{1} was defeated
on their way to {2}" (not hostile), "{1} against {2} has been defeated" (its leader fought a player squad) or "{1} to {2} has failed"; a
`loss trigger` roll when it reached the town or fought the player, else a hostile one is requested again in uniform[40, 96) h. No relation,
world state, ownership, building or town state changes; looting or occupation are only what the loaded `pt2` packages do. In
every message {1} is the campaign's name and {2} the target town's (the cancel message has only {1}; **Observed**).

### Claiming towns (Meitou; the RE_Kenshi plugin Town Ownership)

The original has no way to take a town. The RE_Kenshi plugin Town Ownership ("Conquest", Workshop 3750141111, closed source) adds one; Meitou's `Towns.TownClaimSystem` follows
its Workshop description and its DLL's strings (**Observed**, not traced): a settings window on `'` (claim by **Defeat the ruler** or **Clear entire settlement**, CLAIM RUINED
TOWN, DISMISS CURRENT TOWN), a YES / NO prompt "You have defeated X, the ruler of T. Would you like to claim this town?", and claiming calls `TownBase::setFaction(player)` only.
- Ruler: the town's resident of its faction with the highest bounty (Meitou: a unique character wins a tie; none with no bounty). The plugin's search also looks at the town's
  unique boss squads' leaders; how that ranks against bounty is **Unknown**. It counts when a player character's blow downed it.
- Clear: at least 70 % of the town's own squads' members down or dead. Ruined: none of them alive.
- Meitou keeps the owner apart from the record: `PopulationData.SiteFactions` is the owner (relations, dialogue conditions, campaigns, caravans, the map's owner), `TownFactions`
  the TOWN record's, which still makes the residents, roaming and bar squads, owns the buildings and sets the culture prices, so a claim changes no building or resident.
- Saved in the save (CAMERA `meitou claim method`, `meitou claim<i>` = the town's placement id, `meitou claim from<i>` = the FACTION it was taken from); the plugin kept a
  `TownOwnership.claims` file shared by every save and re-applied it as towns loaded.

## Unknowns

- What sets the character status threat float `+0xac` and the killer handle `+0x2c0` (3.5); what the
  allied byte (+0) and the `trust` floats feed (dialogue conditions, "trustworthy" behaviour).
- What `building designation` changes beyond the bar (it does not enter the chooser); the town node map bar squads use.
- Nest respawn delay after "wiped out", the default of `DAT_142133588` (the Number of nests multiplier option; **Unknown**, the exe image holds zeros there), the rule that makes `TownPopulationManager::vfunc_4`
  declare a town wiped out (**Observed** gates: roaming pool cap <= 3 and <= 25 roaming members).
- Campaigns: TownBase slots 92 / 96, the disabled-town flag, what besides the two calls recomputes the town level,
  the "fought a player squad" test, the announcement wait's event-2 state, task 215's follower steering, the A* road cost, `Platoon::vfunc_25` (sends phase 0 to 2), whether spawned campaign squads are `persistent`, DIPLOMATIC_ASSAULTS.
- `faction gen` at game start.
- Unique characters: the `Character +0x279 & 7` gate and the 0.1 roll against a town list at platoon unload, platoon +0xac, the unit of
  `replacement time` (constant 2618.18 from `FUN_14066cd50`), UNIQUE_SQUAD_TEMPLATE `persistent` use and `missions` (DIPLOMATIC_ASSAULTS),
  the polarity of the import handle test; other readers of `unique` (`FUN_14067b070` dialogue conditions, `FUN_1407609e0` / `FUN_140761550`) not opened.
- Which override town wins among several qualifying candidates; what exactly repopulating a town from its override does.
- Whether the 1250 radius of the proximity helper is squared.
- Patrol routes: the patrol tasks (`Task_Patrol`, `Task_PatrolTown`, `GoOutOnPatrol*`) were not decoded here (class mapping: [ai-tasks.md](ai-tasks.md#tasktype-to-task-class); packages: [ai.md](ai.md#signal-functions-and-the-package-classes)); no fixed route data
  was found in FCS records (squad templates only name `AI packages`; `patrol approaches towns` is a bool).
